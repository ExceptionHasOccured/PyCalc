# Getting Started
## Installing PyMongo
PyMongo allows Python to communicate with the database used in PyCalc. This section of the documentation will show you how to set it up.

### Steps
- Open Command Prompt/Terminal
- Run the following command `python3 -m pip install pymongo[snappy,gssapi,srv,tls]`
Done. Now you can start using PyCalc.
