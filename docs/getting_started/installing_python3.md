# Getting Started
## Installing Python3
Since PyCalc is written in Python, you will need to install the interpreter. This section of the documentation will show you how.

### Installation for Windows
During the setup phase will be working with Command Prompt a fair bit. Despite an installer for Python3 being avaliable on the official website, I recommend using the Microsoft Store variant since it will auto disable an alias for Python put in Windows by default.
- Open Command Prompt
- Type *python3*, this will redirect you to the MS Store
- Click the Install button and wait

Congrats, now you have Python setup on your computer.

### Installation for Ubuntu
Python3 should be installed by default on most Ubuntu Desktop/Server systems but in the case that it isn't, follow these steps.
- Open Terminal
- Type `sudo apt install python3`
- Enter your password
- When prompted type *y* and wait

Congrats, now you have Python setup on your computer.
